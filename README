Over the years, I've manually managed a database table for all of the serial numbers I've purchased for various applications. I've been wanting to give Rails a try for a while now, I figured why not make my first application useful to the most important person in my life: me! :)

This application is my foray into building apps the Rails way (and to Ruby itself). I'm specifically interested in easily and quickly finding records, and making it easy to add new serial numbers to my personal database.

This application requires the will_paginate gem (http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate/installation). To install it, run:

rake gems:install

That all said, you'll have to forgive me if I've made any newbie mistakes or somewhat. I'm sure they will eventually be identified and corrected as I become intimately familiar with Ruby and Rails.
